<b>Monitor and alerts</b>

The main /help page provides a quick start guide to using monitor and alerts within the cumbia-telegram bot.

<b>Security concerns</b>

The bot is designed to prevent from control system overloading in case of a large number of readings.
The bot guarantees that no more than a given number of polling operations in a time slice will be performed on
the network.
As a consequence, the user may experience the following limitations:

- upper limit on the number of monitors operating at the same time
- if the reading of a source is accomplished through a <i>in app poller</i>, timer limitations take place.

The overloading protection implemented by cumbia-telegram bot operates according to these rules:

- the administrator decides the <i>maximum polling period</i> that can be applied to the control system (in milliseconds), as well as the default polling period for each source;
- the algorithm counts the number of sources currently read in polling mode, grouping them by user
- the maximum polling period <i>per user</i> is given by the <i>maximum polling period</i> multiplied by the number of users
- if a user runs multiple polled monitors, the <i>per user period</i> for each of them is further increased.

You should contact the administrator if the constraints are too restrictive. Limits can be relaxed if more readings take place using engine specific event systems rather than exploiting the <i>in app poller</i>.

<b>Note</b>

Plain monitoring of a source may result in frequent messages delivered to your device, causing battery drain and a mass of possibly useless messages.
The advice is to use a formula instead of a plain monitor. For example, instead of

<i>monitor sr/diagnostics/dcct_s4/current</i>

you could combine a couple of monitors shaped as follows:

<i>monitor sr/diagnostics/dcct_s4/current %26#60; 10    // beam dump</i>
<i>monitor sr/diagnostics/dcct_s4/current %26#62; 299    // beam available</i>

Please note the <i>title</i> (or <i>description</i>) defined by the string in <i>comment style</i>.

<b>Aliases</b>

If source names are hard to remember or unhandy to write, just define some aliases and use them as convenient placeholders:

<i>alias ecurr sr/diagnostics/dcct_s4/current</i>

and use them anywhere

<i>alert ecurr %26#60; 10  // beam dump</i>
