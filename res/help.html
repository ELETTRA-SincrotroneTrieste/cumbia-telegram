<b>cumbia telegram bot</b>

<i>Read, monitor </i> and receive <i>alerts</i> from the <i>Tango</i> and <i>Epics</i>
control systems using <i>Telegram</i>.

<b>Read</b>

Send the name of the source you want to read, followed by an optional formula:
  <i>test/device/1/double_scalar</i>
  <i>test/device/2/long_scalar > 100</i>

<b>Monitor</b>

Monitor a source. With no formula, a <i>silent</i> notification is sent when the value changes.
On the other hand, a <i>silent</i> notification is sent when the formula evaluation result is true.

  <i>monitor test/device/1/long_scalar</i>
  <i>monitor test/device/1/double_scalar > 200.0</i>

<b>Alerts</b>

Receive a notification when a source changes its quality or the evaluation of a formula changes.
Unlike <i>monitors</i>, <i>alerts are not silent</i> but notifications occur only upon source <i>quality</i> or <i>formula truth value</i> changes.

  <i>alert test/device/1/long_scalar</i>
  <i>alert test/device/1/double_scalar > 200.0</i>

In the first case, you will be notified when long_scalar quality changes from <i>normal</i> to <i>warning</i> to <i>alarm</i> and viceversa.
In the second, one alert is sent when the value becomes <i>greater than 200.0</i> and <i>another</i> when it <i>goes back below the threshold</i>.

What is the <i>difference</i> between an <i>alert</i> and a <i>monitor</i> configured with the <i>same formula</i>?

- a monitor sends a lower priority notification (a message <i>with no alert sound</i>)
- a monitor sends a message when the <i>formula evaluates to true</i>, an alert when the <i>formula evaluation changes</i>.

What is the <i>difference</i> between an <i>alert</i> and a <i>monitor</i> when <i>no formula</i> is provided?
An <i>alert</i> is issued each time the <i>quality</i> of the reading changes, a monitor sends a (silent) message
on every variation of the value.

<b>Stop monitors</b>

The command <i>stop src-pattern</i> halts the monitor(s) whose sources match the given pattern.
The <i>stop</i> instruction <i>alone</i> halts <i>all</i> the running monitors.
Additionally, monitors can be interrupted from any of their messages or through the lists provided either by /monitors or /alerts commands.

<b>Monitor and alert description</b>

Any comment starting with <i>//</i> <i>after the monitor command</i> is used as a title (description) for the command. It will be quoted at the beginning of monitor and alert result messages.
Titles can help identify the source of the result.

The <i>/help_monitor</i> page provides further details.

<b>History</b>

Some special commands display or run operations successfully accomplished in the past overa again:

- /last executes last successful operation

- /reads displays <i>read</i> history and offers short links to repeat actions

- /monitors displays active and expired <i>monitors</i>. The latter can be <i>restarted</i>, the former <i>stopped</i>.

- /alerts displays active and expired <i>alerts</i>. They can be either <i>restarted</i> or <i>stopped</i>.

Older entries are deleted. The history size is decided by the administrator.

<b>Bookmarks</b>

You can set a <i>bookmark</i> to the <i>last successful operation</i> through the /bookmark command. A confirmation message follows.

Likewise, /bookmarks issues the list of bookmarks, from which entries can be deleted or executed.

<b>Tango database search</b>

The <i>search</i> command allows to query the <i>Tango database</i> and look for a device matching a given <i>pattern</i>. This is described in the /help_search documentation.

<b>The host instruction</b>

<i>Tango host</i> can be altered with this directive. Refer to the /help_host dedicated page.
